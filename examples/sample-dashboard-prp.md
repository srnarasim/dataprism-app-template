- **Export Capabilities**: Allow users to export filtered data and visualizations

### User Personas
- **Sales Managers**: Need high-level overview and trend analysis
- **Regional Directors**: Focus on geographic performance comparisons  
- **Product Managers**: Require product-specific performance metrics
- **Executives**: Want executive summary views and key metrics

## Technical Requirements

### Data Specifications

  sales_rep: string;      // Sales representative name
  quantity: number;       // Units sold
  unit_price: number;     // Price per unit
  total_amount: number;   // Total transaction value
}
```

#### Dashboard Components

1. **Summary Cards**
   - Total Revenue (current period vs previous)
   - Total Units Sold
   - Average Order Value
   - Number of Transactions
   
2. **Time Series Chart**
   - Monthly/quarterly revenue trends
   - Overlay previous year data for comparison
   - Interactive time range selector

3. **Regional Performance Map**
   - Geographic visualization of sales by region
   - Color-coded performance indicators
   - Click-to-drill-down functionality

4. **Product Performance Table**
   - Top 10 products by revenue
   - Growth rate indicators
   - Stock level integration (if available)

5. **Sales Rep Leaderboard**
   - Performance ranking
   - Target vs actual metrics
   - Quarterly performance trends

#### Interactivity Features
- **Date Range Picker**: Custom date range selection
- **Multi-select Filters**: Category, region, sales rep filtering
- **Drill-down Capability**: Click charts to see detailed breakdowns
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant visualization updates on filter changes
- **Export Options**: PDF reports, Excel exports, chart images

## User Experience Requirements

### Workflow
1. User uploads CSV file via drag-and-drop interface
2. System validates data format and shows preview
3. Dashboard automatically generates with default views
4. User applies filters and explores data interactively
5. User exports selected insights for reporting

### Accessibility
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- High contrast mode support
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet

### Error Handling
- Clear error messages for invalid data formats
- Graceful degradation for large files
- Loading states for all async operations
- Retry mechanisms for failed operations

## Sample Data Structure

```csv
date,product_id,product_name,category,region,sales_rep,quantity,unit_price,total_amount
2024-01-15,SKU001,Wireless Headphones,Electronics,North,John Smith,2,99.99,199.98

## Development Notes

This PRP should be used with the DataPrism App Template's `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` Claude Code commands. The implementation will leverage the existing template structure while adding the specific sales dashboard functionality described above.

Key template components to extend:
- `FileUpload` component for CSV processing
- `SimpleChart` component for visualization
- `DataPrismContext` for data management
- Error handling and loading states

The resulting dashboard will serve as both a functional sales analytics tool and a demonstration of the DataPrism ecosystem's capabilities for building sophisticated data applications.
